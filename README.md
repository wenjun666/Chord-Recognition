# Chord-Recognition

# Project Ideas
In this project, we are doing chord recognition, which takes in a .wav file and outputs a graph showing what piano notes are 
of each individual sound signal in the file. Within Spyder, simply put a .wav file in the same directory as of chordRecognition.py 
and change the global variable filename at the top of the program. Use Python Console instead of iPython Console to run the program so 
that the output graph is large enough with details. Specific usage of functions and variables is written in comments in the program.
